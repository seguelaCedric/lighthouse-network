# LIGHTHOUSE CREW NETWORK - Business Plan

## Executive Summary

Lighthouse Crew Network is a **neutral infrastructure platform** for yacht and luxury villa crew recruitment. It solves the existential threat facing recruitment agencies: free WhatsApp groups and cheap job boards are commoditizing placements, while the "first CV wins" rule forces a race to the bottom on quality.

**The Opportunity**: Transform from a single agency (€1M/year revenue) into the industry's trusted infrastructure layer (€1.3M+ Year 1, €3M+ Year 3).

**The Strategy**: Don't compete with agencies—become the rails they all run on.

## The Problem

### Current Market Reality

```
TRADITIONAL MODEL (dying)              DISRUPTION (killing it)
─────────────────────────              ─────────────────────────
Agency charges ~€4,000/placement   →   WhatsApp groups: FREE
Agency maintains database          →   Job boards: €35-55/month
Agency verifies candidates         →   Direct hiring: no verification
Agency handles paperwork           →   Captains hire friends
```

### The "First CV Wins" Problem

Industry operates on an unwritten rule: **whoever submits a candidate first gets the placement fee**. This creates:

1. **Speed over quality** - Agencies blast CVs without proper vetting
2. **Duplicate submissions** - Same candidate sent by 5 agencies
3. **Disputes** - "I sent them first!" with no proof
4. **Client frustration** - Inbox flooded with unqualified candidates
5. **Race to bottom** - No time for proper matching

### Agency Death Spiral

```
WhatsApp groups grow
        ↓
Candidates bypass agencies
        ↓
Clients get free candidates
        ↓
Why pay €4,000 fee?
        ↓
Agencies lose placements
        ↓
Agencies cut corners
        ↓
Quality drops
        ↓
Clients trust agencies less
        ↓
More direct hiring
        ↓
Repeat until dead
```

## The Solution: Lighthouse Network

### Three Pillars

#### 1. TIMESTAMP AUTHORITY
**The neutral ledger everyone trusts**

- Immutable submission timestamps (blockchain-style hashing)
- Clear "first submission" proof
- Ends disputes forever
- Creates trust between competing agencies

```
Before: "I sent Sarah first!" / "No, I did!"
After:  Agency A: 14:32:07.234 ✓ FIRST
        Agency B: 14:45:12.891 (13 min later)
```

#### 2. COLLABORATION EXCHANGE
**Turn competitors into partners**

- Agency A has candidate, no matching job
- Agency B has job, no matching candidate
- Platform facilitates introduction
- Fee splits automatically: 45% / 45% / 10% platform

```
Before: Candidate sits in database unused
After:  Candidate placed via partner agency
        Both agencies earn, platform earns
```

#### 3. QUALITY CERTIFICATION
**Verification tiers that mean something**

| Tier | What's Verified | Who Sees Full Profile |
|------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Basic | Registered | Only registering agency |
| Identity | ID + docs checked | All network agencies (contact redacted) |
| Verified | References called | All agencies + shortlist clients |
| Premium | Full background + Vapi voice check | Everyone (premium badge) |

## Competitive Positioning

### Why Not Just a Job Board?

```
CREWDAR / DOCKWALK / YOTSPOT        LIGHTHOUSE NETWORK
─────────────────────────────       ─────────────────────
Job listings                    →   Full recruitment workflow
Candidates apply directly       →   Agencies control submissions
€35-55/month                   →   Platform fee on success
No verification                →   Tiered verification system
Competing with agencies        →   Empowering agencies
```

### Why Agencies Will Join

1. **"We're all dying together"**
   - WhatsApp is the real enemy, not each other
   - Platform levels playing field

2. **Access overflow revenue**
   - Candidates you can't place → income via collaboration
   - Jobs you can't fill → partner agency fills, you earn

3. **"First CV" proof**
   - No more disputes
   - Clear, neutral timestamp

4. **Client pressure**
   - Clients will demand platform submissions
   - Agencies outside network lose access

5. **AI advantage**
   - Better matching than manual search
   - Brief parsing saves hours

### Why Agencies Won't Fear Cannibalization

**Protection 1: Senior Positions Require Agencies**
```
Captain, Chief Officer, Chief Engineer, Chief Stewardess,
Head Chef, or salary >€7,000/month
→ MUST go through agency
→ No direct client-candidate contact
```

**Protection 2: Contact Information Protected**
```
Basic tier: Only registering agency sees contact
Verified tier: Agencies see profile, not contact
Premium tier: Contact only revealed after submission accepted
```

**Protection 3: No Direct Hiring on Platform**
```
Candidates cannot apply directly to clients
All applications route through agencies
Platform facilitates, doesn't disintermediate
```

## Sales Playbook

### The Pitch to Agencies

> "Look, we're all dying. WhatsApp groups are killing us. Captains hire their friends. Clients ask why they should pay €4,000 when they can post in a Facebook group for free.
>
> We have two choices: keep fighting each other while the market disappears, or build infrastructure that saves us all.
>
> Lighthouse Network isn't another job board. It's the MLS for yacht crew. Same rules for everyone. Timestamp authority so 'first CV' disputes are over. Collaboration exchange so your overflow candidates become revenue instead of sitting in a database.
>
> First 10 agencies get founding member rates. You in?"

### Objection Handling

**"You'll steal our candidates"**
> "Every candidate stays yours. We're not a job board where candidates apply directly. We're infrastructure that makes your candidates more valuable through verification."

**"Why would I share with competitors?"**
> "You're not sharing your best placements. You're monetizing your overflow. That candidate sitting in your database for 6 months? Either place them through a partner or watch them find a job through WhatsApp anyway."

**"What about my client relationships?"**
> "Strengthened. Clients submit briefs to you via the platform. You control what they see. We just make you faster and more accurate."

**"€199/month is expensive"**
> "One collaboration placement pays for 2 years of subscription. One hour saved per brief pays for a month. What's expensive is losing placements to WhatsApp."

### The Pitch to Clients

> "Stop drowning in unqualified CVs.
>
> Post your brief once. Get a shortlist of verified, AI-matched candidates within 24 hours. Every candidate vetted, references checked, certifications confirmed.
>
> See exactly when each candidate was submitted. No more duplicate submissions from different agencies. Clear audit trail.
>
> Your agency still handles everything. We just make them better."

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Agencies Don't Join

**Mitigation**:
- Start with friendly agencies (personal relationships)
- 3 months free for founding members
- Lead with collaboration value (new revenue, not cost)
- Build case studies before broad launch

### Risk: AI Matching Quality Issues

**Mitigation**:
- Human review before client delivery
- Confidence scores flag uncertain matches
- Feedback loop improves model
- Manual override always available
- Start with AI as "assistant" not "replacement"

### Risk: Price Resistance

**Mitigation**:
- ROI calculator: "1 collaboration = 2 years subscription"
- Free tier for small agencies (limited submissions)
- Platform fee only on success (aligned incentives)
- Founding member discounts

### Risk: Incumbent Response

**Mitigation**:
- Execution speed (first mover in AI matching)
- Agency relationships (trust built over years)
- Network effects (more agencies = more valuable)
- Focus on niche (yacht/villa, not general recruitment)

### Risk: Candidate Privacy Concerns

**Mitigation**:
- GDPR compliant from day 1
- Candidates control visibility settings
- Contact info protected by default
- Clear consent at registration
