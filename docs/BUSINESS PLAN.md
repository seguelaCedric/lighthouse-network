# LIGHTHOUSE CREW NETWORK - Business Plan

## Executive Summary

Lighthouse Crew Network is a **premium AI-powered recruitment platform** for yacht and luxury villa crew placement. We solve the critical inefficiency facing luxury crew recruitment: manually processing briefs, searching through databases, and matching candidates takes hours when it should take minutes.

**The Opportunity**: Transform from a manual recruitment agency into an AI-powered placement machine that can process more briefs, make better matches, and deliver higher quality candidates faster than any competitor.

**The Strategy**: Use AI to become the fastest, most accurate crew placement agency in the yacht and luxury household market.

## The Problem

### Current Recruitment Reality

```
MANUAL PROCESS (slow)                  AI-POWERED (fast)
─────────────────────                  ─────────────────────
Brief arrives via WhatsApp         →   Auto-parsed in seconds
Recruiter reads, interprets        →   AI extracts requirements
Manual database search             →   Vector search + AI matching
Review 50+ profiles                →   See top 10 ranked matches
Write candidate summaries          →   AI generates summaries
Hours to shortlist                 →   Minutes to shortlist
```

### The Efficiency Problem

Recruiters spend most of their time on low-value tasks:
1. **Parsing briefs** - Reading emails/WhatsApp, extracting requirements
2. **Searching databases** - Manual keyword searches miss qualified candidates
3. **Reviewing profiles** - Scanning through dozens of unqualified CVs
4. **Writing summaries** - Manually describing why each candidate fits
5. **Coordination** - Email chains, scheduling, status updates

### The Quality Gap

```
Speed vs Quality Trade-off:

Send CVs fast (win placement)
        ↓
Less time for verification
        ↓
Unqualified candidates slip through
        ↓
Client frustration
        ↓
Lost repeat business
        ↓
Reputation damage
```

**Solution**: AI removes the trade-off—be both faster AND more accurate.

## The Solution: Lighthouse Platform

### Three Pillars

#### 1. AI-POWERED MATCHING
**Brief → Shortlist in minutes, not hours**

- AI parses briefs from any source (WhatsApp, email, phone)
- Vector embeddings enable semantic search
- Matching engine ranks candidates by fit
- AI generates summaries explaining why each candidate matches

```
Before: 2-3 hours to produce shortlist
After:  15-30 minutes, higher quality matches
```

#### 2. QUALITY CERTIFICATION
**Verification tiers that mean something**

| Tier | What's Verified | What Client Sees |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Basic | Registered | Limited profile |
| Identity | ID + docs checked | Full profile (contact redacted) |
| Verified | References called | Full profile + reference summary |
| Premium | Full background check | Premium badge + detailed report |

#### 3. CLIENT SELF-SERVICE
**Clients review candidates without constant calls**

- Clients view shortlists via secure portal
- Feedback system (interested/maybe/no)
- Interview scheduling
- Real-time status updates

```
Before: "Any updates?" calls every day
After:  Client sees status in real-time
```

## Sales Playbook

### The Pitch to Clients

> "Stop wasting time on unqualified CVs.
>
> Tell us what you need—via WhatsApp, email, or phone—and we'll deliver a shortlist of verified, AI-matched candidates within 24 hours. Every candidate vetted, references checked, certifications confirmed.
>
> Review candidates on your own time through our client portal. Give feedback with one click. Schedule interviews directly.
>
> You get the speed of a job board with the quality of a premium agency."

### Objection Handling

**"Why should I pay €4,000+ when I can post on Crewfinders for free?"**
> "You get what you pay for. Free posts bring 100 unqualified applications you have to sort through. We bring 5 verified candidates who actually match your requirements. Your time is worth more than that."

**"I've used agencies before and they just send whoever's available"**
> "That's because they're manually searching databases. We use AI matching that actually reads your brief and finds candidates who fit. Plus our verification system means every candidate has been checked."

**"Can't I just hire through my Captain's network?"**
> "You can, but you're limited to who they know. Our database of 2,000+ verified candidates gives you access to the best talent, not just the most connected."

**"Your fee is higher than other agencies"**
> "You're paying for speed, quality, and convenience. Same-day shortlists, verified candidates, self-service portal. One bad hire costs more than our fee in training, turnover, and hassle."
